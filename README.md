# Media Library: CMIS 202 Major Project Assignment


### Who are the users of this software?

The users of this software could include collectors who want to keep track of their physical or digital collections, or anyone who interacts with a lot of media and wants to keep track of their statistics. It can also be used by people who are passionate about a certain medium (e.g., movie buffs, gamers) and want to carefully keep track of their consumption history.


### What is the purpose of this software?

The purpose of this software is to log pieces of media and sort and display them in a fashion both helpful and visually appealing.


### Where and when will the software be used?

There isnâ€™t a specific time or place when it would be used, but seeing as most modern media is often consumed on user devices (phones, laptops, televisions), this software would be used most often on home devices.


### How does this software work?

This software will allow users to add, remove, view, edit, sort, and search through the media they have logged, including movies, shows, games, music, and books. It stores the information in a binary data file and references this file every time it opens. 


### Why would anyone want to use this over existing processes?

Compared to other popular services and applications, like Letterboxd and Goodreads, Media Library has two significant differences: It is more general, and it has a greater emphasis on visualizing data in a satisfying way. It also lacks an online social element as the focus is more on user-specific data.
